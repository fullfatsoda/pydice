# pydice
A dice rolling program written in python. Will roll standard dice used in D&D and other tabletop games.

## Requirements
PySimpleGUI==4.24.0

tk==0.1.0

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the program
You will need Python 3.6+ to run this program. Meet the requirements with pip as mentioned above. Then simply run from terminal `python pydice.py` to load up the gui.

I recommend running in a virtual environment.

```
mkdir pydice
virtualenv --python python3 pydice
source pydice/bin/activate
```
Clone the Repo and move `pydice.py & requirements.txt` to the *pydice* directory.

```
cd pydice
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pydice.py
```
